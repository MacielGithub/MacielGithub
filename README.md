- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MacielGithub
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a Production Engineering currently finishing my graduation, I just got interested in data science, so I've been learning python and using PowerBI at work as an intern.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently developing my programming skills, getting into this whole new world.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I got a step into music :) it's a hobby that might become a part time job.
