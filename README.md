- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Felipe @MacielGithub
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a brazilian Production Engineer finishing my graduation, I just got interested in data science, so I've been learning python and using PowerBI at work as an intern.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I got a step into music :) it's a hobby that might become a part time job.
